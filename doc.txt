System Architecture & Data Flow
-----------------------------
The system is organized into modular components:
- Data Layer: Handles ingestion, cleaning, and storage of raw, processed, and feature-engineered data (see /data directory).
- Model Layer: Contains category-specific XGBoost models, training scripts, and performance logs (see /models, model_development.py, improved_model_development.py).
- Strategy Engine: Implements pricing logic, discounting, and profit margin rules (pricing_strategy.py).
- Application Layer: Streamlit-based UI for user interaction, batch/single product input, and visualization (streamlit_app.py).
- Integration Layer: (Planned) APIs for e-commerce platform connections and inventory management.

Data flows from ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering → model training → pricing strategy → user interface/output. Logs and performance metrics are stored for monitoring and retraining.

User Guide & Input Requirements
------------------------------
1. Prepare your product data (CSV or manual entry via UI). Required fields: product name, category, manufacturing cost, key features, and optionally, competitor prices.
2. Launch the Streamlit app. Select single or batch pricing mode.
3. Enter product details or upload a batch file. Choose the relevant category.
4. Review the recommended price, confidence interval, and visual benchmarks.
5. Download pricing reports or export recommendations as needed.

Model Limitations & Interpretation Guide
----------------------------------------
- Recommendations are only as accurate as the input data and current market conditions.
- Models are trained on historical and scraped data; sudden market shifts may reduce accuracy.
- For highly unique or premium products, manual review is advised.
- Confidence intervals indicate the model's certainty; wide intervals suggest higher uncertainty.
- Always consider minimum profit thresholds and business constraints before applying recommendations.

Monitoring, Retraining & Performance
------------------------------------
- All predictions and outcomes are logged (see /logs).
- Model drift is monitored via periodic performance checks (RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE, % within 10%).
- Automated retraining pipelines can be set up to refresh models as new data arrives.
- Performance summaries are available in models/model_performance_summary.csv and logs.

Security, Privacy & Compliance
-----------------------------
- Seller and product data are stored securely; sensitive fields are encrypted.
- Authentication is required for API and UI access (see planned integration layer).
- Data retention and deletion policies should be defined per business requirements.
- All logs and reports are stored locally unless configured otherwise.

Deployment & Troubleshooting
----------------------------
- To deploy, package the app and dependencies, and run on a server or cloud VM with Python 3.10+.
- For API integration, see planned endpoints in pricing_agent.md.
- Common issues: missing dependencies (check requirements.txt), data format errors (see logs), model performance warnings (see model_performance_summary.csv).
- For UI or prediction errors, consult streamlit_app.log and pricing_strategy.log.

API Integration & Extensibility
-------------------------------
- The codebase is designed for easy extension: add new data sources, categories, or pricing rules as needed.
- Planned: REST API endpoints for real-time pricing, inventory sync, and platform integration (see pricing_agent.md).
- Batch processing and reporting can be customized in pricing_strategy.py and streamlit_app.py.

Maintenance Checklist
---------------------
- Regularly update data and retrain models for best accuracy.
- Monitor logs for errors or drift.
- Review and update requirements.txt for dependency changes.
- Test new features in a staging environment before production deployment.

Governance, Oversight & Audit
-----------------------------
- All autonomous decisions are logged for auditability.
- Manual override and approval workflows are recommended for high-impact price changes.
- Regular review of model and strategy performance is advised.

- For persistent issues, retrain models and verify data integrity

C. Glossary
- RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error
- MAE: Mean Absolute Error
- MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- R²: Coefficient of Determination
- Batch Pricing: Pricing multiple products at once
- Model Drift: Degradation of model accuracy over time

D. Model Performance Benchmarks
------------------------------
- Each model is evaluated on multiple metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R², and % of predictions within 10% of actual market prices.
- Performance summaries are saved in models/model_performance_summary.csv and models/improved/performance_summary.json.
- Typical benchmarks for a well-performing category model:
  - RMSE: < 10% of average category price
  - MAE: < 8% of average category price
  - MAPE: < 12%
  - R²: > 0.65
  - Within 10%: > 60% of predictions
- Poor model quality is flagged if R² < 0.3 or if RMSE is not better than a mean-prediction baseline.
- Feature importance is visualized and saved for each model to aid interpretation and debugging.

E. Model Monitoring & Retraining Pipeline
-----------------------------------------
- All predictions, input data, and outcomes are logged for traceability.
- Model drift is detected by tracking performance metrics over time; significant drops trigger retraining.
- Automated retraining can be scheduled (e.g., weekly or monthly) or triggered by new data arrival.
- Retraining scripts support versioning and champion-challenger testing for safe model updates.
- Alerts can be configured for performance degradation or data anomalies (see pricing_agent.md for advanced monitoring).

F. Security, Privacy & Compliance Details
----------------------------------------
- All sensitive data (e.g., seller credentials, cost data) is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- User authentication is enforced for both the Streamlit UI and planned API endpoints.
- Access logs are maintained for audit purposes.
- Data retention policies are configurable; default is local storage with manual deletion.
- The system is designed to comply with GDPR and similar data privacy regulations (customize as needed for your jurisdiction).
