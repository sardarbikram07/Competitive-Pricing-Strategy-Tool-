# Price Prediction Model for New Sellers

## Project Overview
Build category-specific XGBoost models that help new sellers determine competitive pricing for their products. The models will prioritize maximum customer attraction as the primary goal, with minimal profit margins sufficient only for business sustainability. This customer-first approach will help new businesses rapidly establish market presence and gain initial traction. Each product category will have its own dedicated model to ensure accurate pricing recommendations based on category-specific market dynamics.

## Input Data
Sellers will provide:
- Manufacturing cost
- Number of product features
- Product category (critical for selecting the appropriate model)
- Brand tier information
- Technology level
- Quality tier
- Other relevant product specifications

## Output
The model will recommend a competitive price that:
- Prioritizes customer attraction above all else
- Positions new sellers at a significant advantage compared to established competitors
- Maintains only the minimum profit margin necessary for business sustainability
- Optimizes for market penetration and customer acquisition

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load the normalized dataset (normalized_dataset.csv)
- Segment data by product categories
- Identify and handle any remaining missing values
- Select relevant features that influence pricing for each category
- Split data into training and testing sets (80/20) for each category

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Create price-to-manufacturing cost ratio for reference
- Calculate category-specific pricing benchmarks
- Develop features that capture market positioning within each category
- Normalize numerical features if needed
- Identify category-specific influential features

### 3. Model Development
- Train separate XGBoost regression models for each product category
- Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation for each category model
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics
- Analyze feature importance to understand price drivers specific to each category

### 4. Competitive Pricing Strategy
- Implement category-specific logic to prioritize aggressive customer attraction pricing
- Apply substantial discount factor (15-25% below market average) to maximize customer acquisition
- Set minimum viable profit threshold only to ensure basic business sustainability (8-12% above manufacturing cost)
- Compare with category lowest quartile prices as benchmark
- Develop dynamic pricing suggestions that become more competitive in highly saturated categories

### 5. Model Deployment
- Develop a Streamlit web application as the user interface
- Implement an intuitive form for new sellers to input their product data
- Add category selection dropdown as the first step to determine which model to use
- Display pricing recommendations with confidence intervals
- Provide interactive visualizations comparing recommended price to category-specific market data
- Include category-specific market benchmarks for context
- Enable downloading of pricing reports in PDF format
- Ensure responsive design for both desktop and mobile users

### 6. Validation and Testing
- Test with example products across different categories
- Compare recommendations against actual market prices within each category
- Gather feedback from potential users in various product categories
- Refine models based on category-specific feedback

## Success Metrics
- Pricing recommendations should be 15-25% below average competitor prices in the same category
- Maintain only minimum viable profit margin (8-12% above manufacturing cost)
- Model should recommend prices in the lowest quartile of the category when possible
- Customer acquisition potential should be the primary evaluation metric
- Model accuracy within 10% of actual market competitive prices for each product category

## Additional Project Considerations

### 7. Model Monitoring & Maintenance
- Implement logging to track model predictions and actual outcomes
- Set up automated retraining pipeline for models when performance degrades
- Create dashboards to monitor model drift over time
- Establish alerting system for significant market changes that may impact model accuracy

### 8. Security & Privacy
- Ensure secure storage of seller data and model parameters
- Implement authentication for accessing the prediction service
- Apply proper encryption for any sensitive information
- Establish data retention policies

### 9. Documentation
- Create detailed technical documentation for developers
- Develop user guide for sellers explaining input requirements
- Document model limitations and appropriate use cases
- Provide interpretation guides for pricing recommendations

### 10. Future Enhancements
- Integration with inventory/product management systems
- Time-series forecasting for optimal price changes over time
- Competitive analysis reports based on market data
- A/B testing framework to evaluate different pricing strategies
- Multi-language support for international sellers
